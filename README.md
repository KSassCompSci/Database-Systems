* # Database Systems (MySQL)

Academic coursework and projects focused on relational database design and SQL querying using **MySQL** (skills directly transferable to **PostgreSQL**).

## What this repository demonstrates
- Writing **complex SQL** (multi-table JOINs, subqueries, aggregations, views)
- **Schema design** (normalization, keys/constraints, ER modeling)
- Basic **query optimization** concepts (indexes, execution considerations)
- Building and validating datasets for analytics/reporting-style outputs

## Topics covered
- Relational modeling & normalization (1NF/2NF/3NF)
- JOIN patterns (INNER/LEFT), GROUP BY/HAVING
- Subqueries, views, constraints, transactions
- Indexing fundamentals

## Notes
This is academic work. I’m using it to reinforce database fundamentals for production support and platform troubleshooting.
