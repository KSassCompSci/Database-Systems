* # Database Systems Projects (MySQL)

* Academic coursework and projects focused on relational database design and SQL querying using **MySQL** (skills directly transferable to **PostgreSQL**).

**Tech Stack:** SQL • MySQL • Relational Schema Design • Data Integrity

## What this repository demonstrates
- Writing **complex SQL** (multi-table JOINs, subqueries, aggregations, views)
- **Schema design** (normalization, keys/constraints, ER modeling)
- Basic **query optimization** concepts (indexes, execution considerations)
- Building and validating datasets for analytics/reporting-style outputs

### Project Highlights for Production Support:
* **Complex Query Construction:** Designed and optimized SQL queries using inner/outer joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions to extract business intelligence.
* **Schema Design:** developed normalized database structures (3NF) to ensure data consistency and reduce redundancy.
* **Data Manipulation:** Handled bulk data insertion and updates, simulating the management of ETL pipelines and data maintenance.

## Topics covered
- Relational modeling & normalization (1NF/2NF/3NF)
- JOIN patterns (INNER/LEFT), GROUP BY/HAVING
- Subqueries, views, constraints, transactions
- Indexing fundamentals

## Notes
This is academic work. I’m using it to reinforce database fundamentals for production support and platform troubleshooting.
